## how to install(for noob):
1. download python 3.10: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. go to terminal and enter `pip3 install pygame` to install pygame
3. go to the folder "tanqi" (use `cd`)
4. enter `python3 main.py`

or just do step 1 and go to terminal and run this code:
```
pip3 install pyyaml
pip3 install pygame
git clone https://github.com/jason31416/tanqi.git
cd tanqi
python3 main.py
```

### after installing, when you wan't to open it again, use
```
cd tanqi
python3 main.py
```

if it doesn't work, then run `xcode-select --install` first and then run the previous code again.
